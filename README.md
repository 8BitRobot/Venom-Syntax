# Venom-Syntax
A grayscale syntax theme for Atom that's easy on the eyes but still allows for productive coding.

## Features
* everything's in either black, white, or a shade of gray, so no more burning out your eyes trying to code at night.
* looks good with dark themes everywhere else
* no microtransactions, so you get a sense of pride and accomplishment when ~~paying for~~ downloading, uh, yeah, downloading the theme
* it's a syntax theme, how many features can I even add
* most people don't read this far anyway
* quick time to add some more features because people usually just read the beginning and the end
* meaningful keyword highlights that allow you to find things faster
* intuitive color choices, making constant numbers and strings and methods brighter and operators and comments darker
